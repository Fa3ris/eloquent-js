- Good program design is subjective â€” there are trade-offs involved and matters of taste
    - ease of use: interface is simple, familiar and predictable, follow idioms, calling conventions of the language
    - do not constrain I/O e.g. do not force to read and write to disk
    - ease of composing with other modules - stay focused on one thing
    - if simple function suffices, use a simple function, no need to define complex type to pass data

- /!\/!\/!\ The fact that something sounds like an object DOES NOT automatically mean that it should be an object in program. /!\/!\/!\

- TODO: implement parcel delivery in module style architecture if feel motivated

I received the following requirements

Create a button that once clicked showcases the current price of Bitcoin
After the button is clicked the buttons text changes from "get Bitcoin price" to "refresh Bitcoin price"
After the button is clicked it changes color from blue to purple
Once the button is clicked a field shows up with "Current price: " after a consecutive click a second field shows up with "Previous price: "
This was the entirety of the brief, the assignment had little to no restrictions to it. You can use libraries however you like them. You can use outside sources to fill in the code and you have 1 hour to complete it.
