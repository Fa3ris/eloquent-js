- Good program design is subjective â€” there are trade-offs involved and matters of taste
    - ease of use: interface is simple, familiar and predictable, follow idioms, calling conventions of the language
    - do not constrain I/O e.g. do not force to read and write to disk
    - ease of composing with other modules - stay focused on one thing
    - if simple function suffices, use a simple function, no need to define complex type to pass data

- /!\/!\/!\ The fact that something sounds like an object DOES NOT automatically mean that it should be an object in program. /!\/!\/!\

- TODO: implement parcel delivery in module style architecture if feel motivated
